* Export elements and relationships to a graph database (Neo4j) to ease impact analysis
* Version models and model components:
   * Keeps track of who does what
   * Ability to roll back any component to any point in time
* Ability to share components between models (all the updates done on those components through one model will be visible in all shared models).
