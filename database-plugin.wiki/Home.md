This is a plugin for [Archi 4.x](http://www.archimatetool.com/), the free Archimate Tool.

It allows to _**store models into a central repository**_.

## Key functionalities
* Export to, and import back models from a SQL database (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostGreSQL, and SQLite are supported so far),
* Export elements and relationshiops to a graph database (Neo4j) to ease impact analysis,
* Version the models and all their components:
   * Keeps a trace of who does what
   * Allows to roll back any component to any point in time
* Allow to share components between models (all the updates done on those components through one model will be visible in all the models).
