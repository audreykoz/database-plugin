Version 1.x of the plugin was created for Archi 3.x (Archimate 2) and migrated to Archi 4.x (Archimate 3) but has got very limited functionality. It is not supported anymore.

***
The version 2.x of the plugin is working with Archi 4.x.

The roadmap includes the following points:
* Make the plugin more collaborative
* Improve the conflict resolution mechanism
* Add a procedure to find a model (or a component) by a property or its content
* Add a management console that will allow to do some housekeeping (find orphans components, delete components or model, ...)
* Manage access rights (hide models or components to some people, make them read only to others, ...)
