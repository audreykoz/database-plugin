# Plugin Configuration

The plugin is configured through a dedicated preferences page that can be accessed using Archi's **preferences** menu option.

This preference page has two tabs:
* Behaviour
* Logger

## The Behaviour Tab: 
The Behaviour page allows you to configure your databases and various export/import settings. The following information is contained in the behavior tab: 
### Plugin Versioning: 
The plugin shows its version.

The **Check for update** button connects to GitHub to verify available versions, and automatically update itself if a new version is available.

This check can be automated when Archi starts using the **Automatically check for update at startup** option.

When behind a corporate proxy, the following lines must be added to the **archi.ini** file:
>-Dhttp.proxyHost=_\<proxy name or IP address\>_<br>
>-Dhttp.proxyPort=_\<proxy port\>_<br>
>-Dhttp.proxyUser=_\<username if credentials are required\>_<br>
>-Dhttp.proxyPassword=_\<password if credentials are required\>_<br>
>-Dhttps.proxyHost=_\<proxy name or IP address\>_<br>
>-Dhttps.proxyPort=_\<proxy port\>_<br>
>-Dhttps.proxyUser=_\<username if credentials are required\>_<br>
>-Dhttps.proxyPassword=_\<password if credentials are required\>_<br>
>-Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=<br>
>-Djdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes=

### Databases
You can configure one or several databases that the plugin will be able to connect to.
![database plugin - preference page - behaviour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9281982/39574022-e94e44f2-4ed5-11e8-9fa8-921560e3fda8.png)

You may enter your database connection information (the fields are shown when relevant, else, they are hidden):
* _**Name**_: your database connection's name that will show up in Archi when using the plugin
* _**Driver**_: a dropdown list to select the driver that will be used to connect to the database. So far, the following drivers are supported : MS SQL, MySQL, Neo4j, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
* _**File**_ (specific to SQLite databases): file name containing the database
* _**Server**_: the IP address or DNS name of the server which hosts your database.
* _**Port**_: the TCP port your database listens to
* _**Database**_: the database name you're connecting to
* _**Schema**_: the name of the schema containing the tables you want to access in your database
* _**Username**_: the username used to connect to the database
* _**Password**_: the password used to connect to the database
* _**Export type**_: you may only specify this if the database will contain the whole model (including views and images) or elements and relationships
* _**Export mode**_: you may choose between the Collaborative mode and the Standalone mode (more information on the [Exporting a model page](https://github.com/archi-contribs/database-plugin/wiki/4.-Exporting-a-model))
* _**Export view images**_: you may choose if you wish to store screenshots of your views in the database (.png format).
* _**Export graph mode**_ (specific to Neo4J databases): in native mode, Archi relationships are exported as Neo4J relationships which does not allow relationships on relationships. In extended mode, Archi relationships are exported as nodes which make requests more complex but does allow relationships on relationships.
* _**Empty database**_ (specific to Neo4J databases): allows one to empty the database before exporting the model or to keep the existing graphs

The databases are sorted in the table, with the first database becoming the default database.

### Miscellaneous
The following options allows you to adapt the plugin's behaviour to your needs:
#### Automatically start to export to default database:
When checked, this options tells the plugin to automatically start to export the model when the export window is opened, without waiting for the user to click on the "export" button.
#### Automatically close import and export window on success:
When checked, this option tells the plugin to automatically close the import/export window if the import/export is successful without waiting for the user to click on the "close" button.
#### Remove model's dirty flag after successful export:
Archi maintains a dirty flag on every model that has been modified and needs to be saved. When checked, this option tells the plugin to clear this dirty flag after a successful export.
#### Compare model to the database before export:
When checked, this option tells the plugin to compare the model to the database and print the comparison result on the export window. This information might be useful to know what the plugin will do, but might be time-consuming on huge models.
#### Keep partially imported model in case of error:
By default, when an error occurs during the import process, the partially imported model is discarded as it contains only a subset of its content. When checked, this option tells the plugin to keep the partially imported model.

Please note that, as this model is not complete, it should not be exported back to the database.
#### Show debugging information in the context menu:
When checked, some debug information will be shown on the context menu that is shown when the user right-clicks on Archi components (the plugin shows the component ID, versions, and checksums).
#### Default component import type:
This options allows you to specify the default behaviour of the "import individual component" process:
* **shared**: the import process keeps components IDs, therefore all the modifications on these components will be seen by the other models that include them. 
* **copy**: the import process will duplicate the components IDs, therefore all the modifications on these components will not be seen by other models.

## Logger
The logger tab provides options for debugging the plugin. "Simple" and "Expert" modes for debugging are available, but please note that enabling these modes will affect plugin performance speeds. The default log file name is "DatabasePlugin.log", although you may specify your own log file and file location if needed.
