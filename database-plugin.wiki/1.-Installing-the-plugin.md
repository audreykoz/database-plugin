# Installing the plugin
The plugin consists of a single JAR file called _**org.archicontribs.database_xxx.jar**_.

There are several ways to install the plugin:
# First installation method
Download the JAR file file and copy it into the Archi's _**plugins**_ folder.

The Archi's plugins folder is usually located at _C:\Program Files\Archi\plugins_ on a Mac or at _C:\Program Files (x86)\Archi\plugins_ on Windows. You will need to restart Archi after adding the plugin. 

Once you restart Archi, you should be able to see new "import" and "export" menus:
