# The export window
Selectingthe **Export to database** menu option launches the export window.

This export window is compound of 5 areas:
* The left area shows the list of export steps,
* The right area is separated in 3 zones:
  * The top zone allows to select the database to export to,
  * The middle zone lists the versions of the model in the selected database and allows to change the model name and purpose, and to fill-in a release note,
  * The bottom zone indicates the number and the status of all the model's components,
* The bottom horizontal area shows the **Export** and **Cancel** buttons

# The export process
The export process is done in 4 distinct steps:
1. Count components and calculate a checksum on each of them.

2. Compare the model to the database, using the checksums calculated in step 1.

  * **Standalone mode**
    * Components that have been updated in the model are tagged for exportation to the database
    * Components that have been updated in the database are tagged as conflicting
  * **Collaborative mode**
    * Components that have been updated in the model are tagged for exportation to the database
    * Components that have been removed from the model are tagged for removal in the database
    * Components that have been updated in the database are tagged for import/sync from the database
    * Components that have been removed from the database are tagged for removal in the model
    * Only Components that have been updated in both the model and the database as tagged as conflicting

3. Conflict resolution
All the conflicts must be resolved before the export can be really done.

The plugin presents the components as they are in the model and in the database. The user needs to choose which version has to be retained:
* **Do not export**: The component is not updated in the database, thus the conflict will have to be resolved during the next export
* **Export**: The model version will be exported to the database
* **import**: The database version will be imported to the model

4. The plugin exports the components that have been updated.
Once all the previous steps are done, the components are exported to the database:
* The version of exported components is increased
* The model components are registered in the new model version

It is of course possible to export a model that has not be imported first (i.e. imported from a .archimate file). But in this case, the plugin automatically switches in standalone mode.
